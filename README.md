# Data Analysis:
##### Data Extraction: The data used in this project was stored in a MySQL database, which contained detailed records of sales transactions. 

Connecting to MySQL: Tableau was connected directly to the MySQL database using MySQL connectors. This connection allowed for real-time data extraction and ensured that the latest data was always available for analysis.

##### Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Data Cleaning: The extracted data was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies, such as missing values, duplicate records, or incorrect entries.
Data Transformation: Data was aggregated based on various dimensions like time (daily, monthly, quarterly), product categories, and regions to facilitate meaningful analysis.
